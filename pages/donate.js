        The Fuel Rats are an Elite group of pilots who specialize in saving stranded CMDRs from the pitch black abyss of space.
        <br />
        Since 3301, We've built up a plethora of custom tools and services to assist in meeting our ever-growing demand.
        <br />
        With growth has come expenses. The cost to keep our lights on has grown significantly, and now exceed â‚¬100 per month.
        <br />
        To assist the dedicated few who have been helping with these costs privately, we have now opened donations to the general public!
